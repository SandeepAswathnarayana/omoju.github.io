 Sometime in last year, I decided to be a technovation instructor for their <a href="http://iridescentlearning.org/programs/technovation-challenge/" title="Technovation">technovation challenge</a>, an after school program that teaches girls to design their own android apps and gives them a fast and furious lesson in creating a start-up. We were lucky, we got to spend eight glorious weeks in the Google office in San Francisco. 

It was through that experience that I got to meet Emilie Robert Wong, a gifted young woman. When I met her, she had already won the previous years challenge. After the program was over, we met up again at the <a href="http://ww2.ncwit.org/award/award.index.php">Bay Area NCWIT Affiliate <i> Aspirations in Computing Award </i></a>, where I was a panelist. I invited her over to come visit with us at ICSI. She met fellow scientist and learned about life in a research institute. I am forever grateful for the in-depth conversation we had with my fellow colleague <a href="http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~nweaver/" title="Nick">Nicholas Weaver</a>. 

I really believe in mentorship, particularly when it comes to women and under-represented minorities in technology. One of the reasons why I am in this field is because I saw female technical faculty like <a href="http://www.cs.kent.edu/~volkert/" title="Gwenn">Gwen Volkert,</a> <a href="https://louisville.edu/bucksforbrains/faculty/nasraoui" title="Olfa">Olfa Nasaroui</a>, and <a href="http://umwa.memphis.edu/fcv/viewprofile.php?uuid=adejongh" title="Dr Curry">Amy De Jongh Curry</a>. 

Here is the amazing Emilie doing her thing. You can read about her some more in this <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/women-20/hammer-up_b_1503753.html" title="Emilie">Huffington Post write up</a>
