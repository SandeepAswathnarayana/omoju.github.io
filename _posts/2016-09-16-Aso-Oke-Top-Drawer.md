Àsó Oké - Top Drawer, absolutely worth your watch. I grew up neighbors with her, never meet her, but the view from my father's bedroom window looked directly into their compound. When I looked at the house, I always thought Elizade lived there. Didn't imagine that something else was brewing in that house. That the house harbored another of Africa's vernacular denizen.

Deola Sagoe belongs alongside Demas Nwoko, Ikiré Jones, Kunle Adeyemi, David Adjaye, Chris Abani and so on. African artist who transform their medium through their communion with the west. Persons who aspire to reify the "African Eye," the African way of knowing into its highest expression.
