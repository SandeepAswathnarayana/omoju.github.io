<p>Last April, I got a chance to participate in a panel discussion at <a href="http://citris-uc.org/" title="citris">CITRIS</a> on social justice in the age of big data. The conference was a collaboration between CITRIS and the <a href="http://africam.berkeley.edu/" title="afam berkeley">Department of African American Studies at UC Berkeley</a>, the conference was held on Thursday, April 26, 2012. The aims were to connect Social Innovation and Big Data, seek to develop new notions regarding the transference of ideas and methods among diverse communities, and specifically the making of apps in the interest of society.</p>
