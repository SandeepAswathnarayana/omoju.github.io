Recently I got an invitation from Etsy Engineering Code As Craft to present my doctoral research where I used machine learning techniques to investigate student decision making around choosing computer science. Below is the blurb about the talk. I hope you enjoy it.

There is a myth in technology that talent stems from innate ability. Really though it’s a process of learning and hard work.

As seen through history, technology can destabilize the jobs market. This begs the question: what are truck drivers going to do in the age of driverless cars? Omoju Miller’s work puts forward the idea that we can scale adult technical education for workforce readiness while leveraging that opportunity to equalize participation. In her doctoral work at Berkeley she’s taken a machine learning approach into understanding why students choose Computer Science.
