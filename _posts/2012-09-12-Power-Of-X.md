<p>I was featured in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjisSInTmYo&amp;feature=youtu.be" title="Video of What is TEDx?">What is TEDx? </a>video. "You can do the Impossible. You don't need to wait for someone else to do it. . . I can do it!"</p>
<p>"After attending the summit, I realized just how powerful ideas can be. This might sound like a cliche, but when you are in the throws of everyday life, you forget just how life changing an idea can be. Here at Berkeley, we have an amazing heritage of change, our research activities have changed the course of the modern world for better(Protest and Resistance) and for worse (Atom Bomb). We at TEDxEuclidAve, are committed to harnessing the power of ideas. I will end by restating what I have being reminded of: An inspirational idea will eventually lead to action. Seize the day, change the world, that is the power of X." See more at the <a href="http://www.tedxeuclidave.com" target="_parent">TEDxEuclidAve </a>that I organized.
