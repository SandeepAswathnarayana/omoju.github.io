"As technology advances, it is easier for us to do things, but it is also easier for us to skip, to treat it like food in a microwave, versus a Michelin star chef cooking food that taste great, that you will drive and fly miles to get, that will not taste like the microwave food." - NO I.D. Wilson

Which one do you want to be? Do you want coding food from the microwave, or want the Michelin Chef? Both of them will satiate your hunger, but they are not the same thing. Pick wisely my friends.
