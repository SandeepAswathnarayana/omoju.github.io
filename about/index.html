				This blog is a collection of essays that encompass culture and technology. She believes the over all theme of the blog is wrestling with issues of inequality, and understanding how tech for social good can help address some of them. Ever the dreamer, she believes that if we have courageous conversations, we might just stumble on great solutions!
