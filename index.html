<p>For many people, when they think of hip-hop, they don’t think Artificial Intelligence. I, on the other hand do. I have this crazy theory that hip-hop can be used to introduce diverse populations to the beauty and joy of computation, through the delightful area of natural language processing. It is unfortunate that some elements of Artificial Intelligence are not part of introductory Computer Science, this is where a lot of the delights reside.</p>

<p>This belief started taking root in my mind when I was doing my masters at the University of Memphis. My work was focused on the semantic web, where we built ontologies. This coincided with the same time that I was super heavy into Jay Z. Everyday I would drive to lab listening to Jay, and spending inordinate amounts of time trying to divine the meaning of his lyrics and their implications.</p>

<p>There was this particular line in 03 Bonnie and Clyde, that always had me bothered. It went “The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin, with the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin.” I would often wonder, how that line could be parsed and then ran through an intelligent system that could clearly explicate the implications of that statement.</p>

<p>Over the years, my love of Jay Z did not diminish, and I was able to see the evolution of thought in his lyrics. At this point, you are probably wondering what has all this got to do with AI or Computer Science? Because I was deeply embedded in semantic web research, I started to see hip-hop lyrics as an object to do computation with. I started to imagine the kinds of things that could be done when computation is brought to bear on a field like hip-hop. Since my work was in natural language understanding, it was the first place I imagined a hip-hop centric CS curriculum. Hiphopathy is a project that begins on that path that I hope eventually leads more people into Computer Science through an embrace of computation in service of the humanities.</p>
